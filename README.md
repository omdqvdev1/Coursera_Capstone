In this work we are going to conduct cluster analysis of Luxembourg. It is a small country in the western Europe, 
landlocked between Belgium, France and Germany. Its population amounts to 590 000 as of 1- Jan-2017. 
Despite of the small size, it is quite a developed country and it attracts lot of foreigners, such as tourists, expats and cross-border workers. 
We will collect information about Luxembourg communes, draw these on the map and conduct cluster analysis based on venues in these communes,
in order to classify them such in terms of touristic/leisure/culture areas. Having the clusters reflected on a map, 
it would be easier for one to understand where to go for a weekend, or for a longer rest, or stay during a business trip. Also, the obtained information could provide a view to quickly understand what area of the 
country or even a commune would represent an interest for a visit/trip/stay/live
